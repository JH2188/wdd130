Some basic lingo to help you navigate the map:
Layaways: Layaways are items ordered in for customers that we did not have right on hand the day the customer came in. Whether it was pulled in from another shop or ordered in from one of our vendors the layaway section is where you will find it.
Work Order-To do’s: this section is where bikes that have come in for repair belong different areas in this section are for different purposes. To Do are work orders that have not been looked at or started.
Waiting for parts: Workorders that are partially completed that need a part coming in from a vendor or another store.
Warranty: this section is for Parts or bikes that have a manufacturer warranty submitted and are waiting for that part.
Completed: This section as the name implies is for completed work orders waiting for the customer to come and pick up.
